description: Why you should prefer having technical discussions in public rather than private messages.
---

In general, prefer having technical conversations in a public forum, such as a
public team Slack channel, Google Doc comment or a GitHub pull request comment
thread.

This applies to:

- [asking the onpoint a technical question](../asking-for-help-on-slack) (_this one in particular!_)
- asking your code reviewer about something they commented in a Pull Request
- talking with coworkers to decide a technical approach for something
- a conversation started in a google doc for scoping a project

Instead of a _private_ Slack chat, consider having the conversation in the
same forum that the question first came up (the team slack channel, Google Doc
or Pull Request).

## Why?

- **Public forums let others weigh in.**

  - It's not unlikely that someone else on the team has an opinion or knows the
    answer.
  - You might get an answer from someone else quicker!
  - Asking the question where others can see it leads to more knowledge sharing.

- **Private channels are private.**

  - There's no searchable paper trail to for future Yelpers to refer back to
    later about the surrounding context in which a decision was made.
  - (Yes this is also true of equivalent in-person meetings, but that's a
    seperate blog post for another day)

- **Private Slack channel message history may be ephemeral by default.**

  - Depending on your Slack plan - you might have to remember to set the private
    slack thread message history beyond some default. Otherwise the message
    history and context may get deleted after some time!

## What should I do if someone DMs me a technical question anyway?

Don't be afraid to gently respond something like "hey, let's take this back to #<team channel> so others can weigh in!" and move the conversation over.

(Or feel free to link to this post for the motivation and let me be the bad guy :P)
